# Self Evaluation

#Functionality 2.5: My methods are functional and I was able to successfully implement CLI. I docked myself .5 because my key is not randomly generated due to not being able to implement my stubs.

#OOP 3:  I believe my classes make sense and do not contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Each class has a single responsibility. No class is too large or small. 

#Ruby Conventions and Mechanics 3: I believe my syntax/code follows convention. And I used the right enumerables/data structures for the job. I can speak to why I used them and I have more than one hash implemented that I believe all make sense.

#TDD 3: I have a test for every method and am testing every function of that method. I address edge cases and I wrote all tests before methods. My test coverage shows 100%. I docked myself .5 because I was not able to implement my stubs but I still believe my testing reflects a 3.

#Version Control 3: I have over 30 commits and more than 3 pull requests, each one related to logical chunks of functionality. I also provide great detail of what I did in my pull requests.
